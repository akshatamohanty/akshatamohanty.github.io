# Principles of Writing

## The Transaction

- There is no one way to do personal work. There are multiple paths, methods and tools. Choose what works for you.
- The author is selling themselves, not the subject. Their enthusiasm, their history, their baggage, their experience.
- The heart of good non-fiction writing is the "personal transaction": humanity and warmth

## Simplicity

- Strip every sentence into its cleanest components.
- Clear thinking translates to clear writing. It is impossible for a muddy thinker to write well.
- When reading something makes you sleep, the writer has caused you too much unnecessary trouble.
- Writers must often ask - what am I trying to say? They often do not know. The clear writer is someone clearheaded enough to see this stuff what it is - fuzz.
- Thinking clearly is a conscious act - that requires logical thinking.

## Clutter

- Writing is about the small details.
- Clutter is jargon that could be replaced with something shorter. It is political correctness gone amok.
- Ways to remove clutter - `Bracket method` (i.e add brackets to phrases that can be discarded withouting changing meaning).
- Most drafts can be cut by 50% without losing ideas.
- Look for clutter and prune ruthlessly.

## Audience

- Only write for yourself.
- People are attracted to authenticity, not prose. Someone sharing something they are incredibly passionate about.
- One is craft, one is attitude. Not boring your audience is precise skill. Attitude is using the skill to express your personality.
- Work hard to master the tools - simplify, prune and strive for order. Make it a mechanical act.
- Express who you are - that's the creative act. Relax and say what you want to say. Only be true to yourself.

## Style

- Style takes time to be uncovered. Strip writing to basics, before you build it back up again.
- Know what the essential tools are and what job they were designed to do.
- Readers want authors to sound genuine: be yourself.
- What writing needs - relaxation and confidence.
- Writers are most natural in first-person.
- But "I" is hard for people to write. It requires taking responsibility for your opinions, or sounds too egotistical.
- Draft in first person and then take the "I"s out, if you are not allowed to write in first person.
- Sell yourself. Your subject will exert appeal.
- Style has roots in psyche.

## Words

- Writers have words as their only tool. Be in love with words. Pay attention to them. Use the dictionary.
- The single biggest profanity in writing is journalese writing - boring, cliched, uninspired jargon.
- Use the thesaurus to innervate your writing and the reader.
- When you write, people just don't read - they hear. The tone, alliterations, excitement. Writing is entertainment.
- Sound the words. Listen to your writing. Because someone else is. Listen to how your words play along. If it sounds boring.
  - change the way the words are arranged.
  - make the phrase shorter to pack a punch.
  - use a word arrangements and rhyming.
  - reverse the order of a sentence.

## Usage

- Language keeps changing
- Good usage is using good words, to express yourself clearly and simply to someone else.

# Attitudes

## The Sound of Your Voice

- Writing is about the author. It is "the author's book about baseball or jazz"
- Cliches or slang lacks style and is breezy
- Good writing is not accidental, it is discipline
- Finding a voice is about taste. Taste is about what not to do.
- Less is more
- Taste can be acquired
- Imitation is part of the creative process
- Fresh imagery is good taste; simple homey words with clear meaning
- Remember the uses of past when you tell your story

# What I love about this book?

- The book itself is an example of all it teaches.
- It has funny examples.
