# Principles of Writing

## Words

- Writers have words as their only tool. Be in love with words. Pay attention to them. Use the dictionary.
- The single biggest profanity in writing is journalese writing - boring, cliched, uninspired jargon.
- Use the thesaurus to innervate your writing and the reader.
- When you write, people just don't read - they hear. The tone, alliterations, excitement. Writing is entertainment.
- Sound the words. Listen to your writing. Because someone else is. Listen to how your words play along. If it sounds boring
  - change the way the words are arranged
  - make the phrase shorter to pack a punch
  - use a word arrangements and rhyming
  - reverse the order of a sentence
