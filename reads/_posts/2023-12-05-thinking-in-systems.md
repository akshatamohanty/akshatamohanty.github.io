Your first system, is you.

Feeling stressed? Go for a run. But why - that's such an absurd thing to do! But it works. The exercise endorphins make you feel calmer. Being calm allows you focus. Focus leads to better problem solving. Problem solving leads to solutions. Solutions reduce stress. Congratulations! You've just used understanding yourself as a system, to produce your desired effect.

Systems thinking is a perspective, of understanding things by looking at them as systems - with elements, inter-relationships and purpose. This book was recommended to me as a go-to for fundamentals of systems thinking.
