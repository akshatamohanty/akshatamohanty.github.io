Learning fascinates me. You are born as a child with innate curiousity. Every touch teaches us something. And we build a mental model of the world around us. The goal of the mental model? To be able to predict the future - to predict outcomes so as to aid survival.

But it's not just that. Learning gives me a kick. There is a sense of achievement, a gratification of some kind. It's a bit like sex? Maybe that is evolutionary.

I stumbled across Ultralearning by Scott Young while research resources to learn things more in-depth. I think of myself as a fast learner. But I wanted a framework for more involved learning with critical thinking.

Here's the framework

|--| -- | -- | -- |
|**Beginner**| Metalearning | Focus | Directness |
|**Intermediate**|Drills | Recall | Feedback |
|**Advanced**|Retention | Intuition | Experimentation |

Also ties into the learning pyramid.

This book did deliver to some extent. The best part of this experience was that - it strategically broke down the process of learning and building a skill. Does that work beyond "skills"? I am not sure.
