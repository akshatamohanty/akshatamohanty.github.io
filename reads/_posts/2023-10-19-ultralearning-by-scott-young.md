This book caught my attention from a self-productivity article (yes, I read a lot of those!).

However, what stood out to me was two things:

- This person had done the entire course content for MIT CS in just one year.
- James Clear (I'm a fan!) had a glowing forward for Scott Young. He stated that his own process of writing Atomic Habits was very similar to the process described in the Ultralearning book.

And one idea by Scott Young stood out to me,

> A deep year, dedicated to your area of interest, is usually enough to be really proficient at it.

It was a light read. So all this was enough to get me sold on reading it.

## The Ultralearning archetype

Scott Young describes Ultralearners almost like an archetype.

Characteristics:

- solo players
- characterized by intensity and commitment
- sacrificed credentials and conformance
- tend towards obsession
- work alone
- only for themselves

It made a uncomfortable. But I do agree agree that often **rapid** deep learning, requires a certain degree of obsession.

## What sets apart ultralearning from traditional learning?

- Aggressively optimizing strategies
- Debating merits - e.g interleaving practice, keyword mnemonics, leech thresholds
- Optimize for efficiency constantly
- Directness in skill development is a priority e.g hands-on practice
- Unorthodox tactics and aggressive analysis
- Spaced Repetition, by Polish researcher - Wozniak.

Ultra learning is three things:

- Strategic
- Self directed
- Intense (unusual steps to maximize their learning)

- Creating a really quick feedback cycle for the material, helped him learn better for his MIT project. Instead of first doing material, then assignment, he mixed the two.
- What is required is an insane obsessive work ethic (de Montebello’s story - ToastMasters World Top 10 in 10 days)

## Principles of Ultralearning

1. Metalearning: First draw the map.
2. Focus: sharpen your knife.
3. Directness: Go straight ahead.
4. Drill: Attack your weakest point.
5. Retrieval: Test to Learn.
6. Feedback: Don’t dodge the punches.
7. Retention: Don’t fill a leaky bucket.
8. Intuition: Dig deep before building up.
9. Experimentation: Explore outside your comfort zone.

Here's the framework,

## How to do your own ultralearning project?

For your own ultra learning project, two important things:

- For each of these principles, keep constantly asking questions on what could be better, what are you doing.
  Do a retro.
- Ultralearning is a strategy. There could be other slower strategies.

## My thoughts

Overall, it was a good read.

Scott Young's framework made sense to me. The framework brought structure to an otherwise intuitive process of self-directed learning. I especially loved the use of examples for each of this elements, and that each chapter had the same structure - it was optimized for effective reading!

My only two points of negative feedback would be:

1. A lot of the methods discussed here probably naturally come to people who decide to embark on a journey of self-directed learning.
2. Ultralearning, or any form of self-learning is really a mental game. Someone has to move beyond thinking and actually do. Even though this book gives techniques on how to learn, talks about directness, but it doesn't give enough to build intent (unlike Atomic Habits).
