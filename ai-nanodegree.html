					<h3>Summary</h3>
					Udacity is a for-profit educational organization founded by Sebastian Thrun, David Stavens, and Mike Sokolsky offering massive open online courses (MOOCs). This specialization was offered by Udacity as six-month, 2-semester program, covering topics in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, as well as a Specialization in either Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing or Voice User Interfaces. I completed the nanodegree by completing 7 required projects with a capstone project in Voice User Interfaces. This is a collection of all my work towards the degree.

<h3 id="project-1-sudoku-solver-using-constraint-propagation-technique">Project 1: Sudoku Solver, using constraint propagation technique</h3>
<p>This was an introductory project to build a Sudoku Solver using contraint propagation. Template code was provided with python functions that needed to be completed. Students were also expected to answer questions about Constraint Propogation. Find my Python solution <a href="https://github.com/akshatamohanty/udacity-ai-nanodegree/blob/master/project-01-sudoku/solution.py">here</a> and my assignments <a href="https://github.com/akshatamohanty/udacity-ai-nanodegree/blob/master/project-01-sudoku/README.md">here</a></p>

<h3 id="project-2-game-playing-agent-using-min-max-and-alpha-beta-pruning-strategies">Project 2: Game Playing Agent, using min-max and alpha-beta pruning strategies</h3>
<p>This was the second project in the nanodegree and we were required to build an adverserial game playing agent for the game. To build the isolation agent - I explored combinations of various strategies such as min-max search, alpha beta pruning with iterative deeping and evaluated 5-6 heuristics to determine the best performing one for position evalution. Find my game <a href="https://github.com/akshatamohanty/udacity-ai-nanodegree/blob/master/project-02-isolation/game_agent.py">here</a> and a report for my heuristic analysis <a href="https://github.com/akshatamohanty/udacity-ai-nanodegree/blob/master/project-02-isolation/heuristic_analysis.pdf">here</a>. I also summarized a research paper on Game Playing Agents and provide a report analyzing different heuristics for game board evaluation: <a href="https://github.com/akshatamohanty/udacity-ai-nanodegree/blob/master/project-02-isolation/research_review.pdf">Research Review: Game Tree Searching by MinMax Approximation by Ron Rivest</a></p>

<h3 id="project-3-optimal-airplane-routes-using-search-algorithms">Project 3: Optimal Airplane Routes, using search algorithms</h3>
<p>The third project was to implement heuristic and non-heuristic planning searches for a airplane cargo problem. The algorithms I implemented were ([code])(https://github.com/akshatamohanty/udacity-ai-nanodegree/blob/master/project-02-isolation/game_agent.py)</p>
<ul>
  <li>breadth first search</li>
  <li>depth first search</li>
  <li>A* star search</li>
  <li>A* with level sum search</li>
  <li>depth limited search</li>
  <li>uniform cost search</li>
</ul>

<p>The report analyzing the performance of the different search algorithms is here: <a href="https://github.com/akshatamohanty/udacity-ai-nanodegree/blob/master/project-02-isolation/heuristic_analysis.pdf">Heuristic Analysis</a>. I also wrote a report on historical developments in AI: <a href="https://github.com/akshatamohanty/udacity-ai-nanodegree/blob/master/project-02-isolation/research_review.pdf">Research Review: Historical Developments in AI</a></p>

<p>This project was the final project of Semester 1. Extracted structured data of the coordinates of the hand positions from videos of people communicating in sign language, was provided.</p>

<h3 id="project-5-dog-recognizer-using-convolutional-neural-networks-cnns">Project 5: Dog Recognizer, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h3>
<p>This was the first project in Semester 2. I used Convolutional Neural Networks using Keras, to create a dog recognizer. The model could take an input image and predict if it was a human or a dog, and the resemblance of either to a dog breed. Major concepts covered were data augmentation, transfer learning, haarcascades, object detection and regonition.</p>

<h3 id="project-6a-stockprice-prediction-using-rnns-for-time-series-prediction">Project 6a: Stockprice Prediction, using RNNs for time series prediction</h3>
<p>The project concentrated on Recurrent Neural Networks. The first part of the project used Apple Stock Prices as time series data and created a model to predict future prices using RNNs with Keras. 
The second part of the project processed text from a novel and created an RNN model to generate more text by performing multiclass classification.</p>

<h3 id="capstone-project-speech-recognition-specialization-voice-user-interfaces">Capstone Project: Speech Recognition [Specialization: Voice User Interfaces]</h3>
<p>This was the final capstone project for the nanodegree. The project was to build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline!  Five models were explored using various layers and configurations like RNNs (GRU, LSTM), Bidirectional RNNs, CNN + RNNs, RNN + Time Distributed Dense, Dropout, Batch Normalization, etc. Students were also required to analyze and study the performance of each of the models and come up with a model of their own.</p>
