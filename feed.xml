        <title>A walk with Eric and Jon</title>
        <description>I am trying to lose weight. And I figured the laziest way of doing that was to walk 4 kilometers back home from work. However, it gets lonely alone - there's only so much streetscape in Singapore! So I picked up How Google Works by Eric Schmidt and Jon Rosenberg to give me company as an audiobook. I don't really know if I lost a lot of weight in the process, but it definitely added a lot to my brain!</description>

Trying to generate a PDF automatically though, inside the Travis environment had some hiccups. This is how to get around it.</description>
