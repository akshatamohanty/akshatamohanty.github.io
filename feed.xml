        <title>AI for Non-PhDs - AI Superpowers for your apps in 30 minutes </title>

And with libraries like Tensorflow and Pytorch, AI is now accessible to developers like you and me, without needing years in a PhD. In this talk, we learn how to build a dog breed classifer and deploy it as a web and mobile app. And all of this, without a server!   </description>

        <title>My takeaways from `How Google Works`</title>
        <description>I am trying to lose weight. And I figured the laziest way of doing that was to walk 4 kilometers back home from work. However, it gets lonely alone - there's only so much streetscape in Singapore! So I picked up How Google Works by Eric Schmidt and Jon Rosenberg to give me company as an audiobook. I don't really know if I lost a lot of weight in the process, but it definitely added a lot to my brain!</description>
