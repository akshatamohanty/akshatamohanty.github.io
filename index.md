I'm a binary brain, in love with code and a serial MOOC-er. An architect by degree, I found my way into software with online courses. I have over 25 online certifications in Web & Mobile Apps, Data Science, Design and Business. 


Fascinated by the human mind, I'm interested in products that enhance human knowledge and creativity. I was the lead developer for <a href='https://github.com/design-automation/mobius-core' target='_blank'><u>Mobius</u></a> - a visual programming tool used at the National University of Singapore. 


While I'm not coding, I'm food-ing. I'm a loyal member of <a href='https://www.meetup.com/Burger-buddies/' target='_blank'><u>Burger Buddies @ Singapore</u></a>. Hit me up for burger suggestions around town!
