Imposter Syndrome is not new to me. 

As a self-taught female software engineer, self-doubt and a fear of being "discovered" and/or missing something often lurks in the background. 

Fast, aggressive and meritocratic startup environments could only make it worse.

So, here's my 4-point checklist to coping.

## See beyond the calamity.

Only way out is through. So when I feel my extreme anxiety creeping back in - I acknowledge it, accept it. I let the walls collapse. I accept that I might not be deserving of the opportunity. I accept that I might fail, get fired or disappoint. 

And then I draw my options from that bad situation. 

For example, when looking my first job as a Software Engineer industry, I gave myself a deadline. If I hadn't made it in 6 months, I'd take the cue that I wasn't good enough and go back to Grad School. Never got to even 3 months, but it brought down my panic.


## Use the count. And repeat.

Numbers beat anxiety. 

It took
* 27 online courses before I worked on a live software project. 
* 180 FreeCodeCamp challenges till I finally "got" Frontend.
* 6 practice tests and ~400 questions to get my Cloud Engineer certification.

I cannot control outcomes. So I control lists.

## Find a niche. Just one thing. 

When I moved from Architecture and Computer Science, my specialized in Building Information Modeling. I'd read entire PhD theses', papers, knew about to extend BIM with plugins and had seeked internships in that one domain. As I become a Senior Engineer, I did the same with Web Performance with React. I did deep-dives on the framework, render cycles, optimizations, learned how to use Performance Tools, did presentations and tech talks. When faced with overwhelming whitespace, it always works to find that one small corner and make it yours. And then grow from there. 


## Build a village.

Meaningful work relationships are often significant for boosts and push-ups. 

* Preparing for Software Engineering interviews, a friend walked me through an entire fullstack app from scratch. 
* My first job as an engineer, my seniors would not only give feedback, but also encouragement and boosts. 
* As I took on Lead Engineer, my mentors and bosses pushed me use my voice without restraint. 

Everytime I am in doubt, I count on my village to be a Hangout, Whatsapp or Hotpot away!


## Proofs. 

You are what you do. When your brain lies to you, you fight it with proof. Proof in things that you do daily. Imposters don't code, read and design everyday.
