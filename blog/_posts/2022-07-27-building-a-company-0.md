Four years back, I moved from `#research` into `#tech`. And I made a deliberate decision to not join a startup. 

The pace, growth and autocracy of a startup appealed to my nature. However, startups work fast. And working fast comes with trade-offs. I wanted to know the trade-offs. 

So I took my time to learn from established large-scale systems, observe "best practices" at work and train with expert mentors and colleagues. And finally, a year back - I joined a startup. 

This series has been a year overdue. 

But nevertheless, here I am, hoping to capture the engineering perspective of building an early-stage startup from scratch. There'll be war and horror stories, hacks, errors and mysteries or just cool bits of technology. Honestly, this mostly serves as my personal technical retrospective. 

So without much ado, here's the first one: 

## Know your user.

We are building a 10x engineering org. (Or so we like to think!)
And DevOps is obviously one of the foundational pieces. 

With that thought, we started our DevOps journey with a simple goal - dockerize our main backend. Purpose was to get consistent dev environments, onboard engineers faster. Happy Engineers = Happy Life!

So after 2 weeks of hacking, going up some knowledge curves and iterations - we managed to get it all dockerized... 

... only to realize that the Docker experience is pretty questionable on Windows. 1 / 2 devs on our team are Windows users. Not Docker-fans and voted against it, when asked. So much for Developer Experience! 

Takeway - know your user.

Anyway, we live to learn another day!
