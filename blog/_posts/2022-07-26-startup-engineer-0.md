Four years back, I moved from `#research` into `#tech`. And I made a deliberate decision to not join a startup. 
<br><br>
The pace, growth and autocracy of a startup appealed to my nature. However, startups work fast. And working fast comes with trade-offs. I wanted to know the trade-offs. 
<br><br>
So I took my time to learn from established large-scale systems, observe "best practices" at work and train with expert mentors and colleagues. And finally, a year back - I joined a startup. 
<br><br>
This series has been a year overdue. 
<br><br>
But nevertheless, here I am, hoping to capture the engineering perspective of building an early-stage startup from scratch. There'll be war and horror stories, hacks, errors and mysteries or just cool bits of technology. Honestly, this mostly serves as my personal technical retrospective. 
<br><br>
So without much ado, here's the first one: 
<br><br>
<br><br>
## Know your user.

We are building a 10x engineering org. (Or so we like to think!)
And DevOps is obviously one of the foundational pieces. 
<br><br>

With that thought, we started our DevOps journey with a simple goal - dockerize our main backend. Purpose was to get consistent dev environments, onboard engineers faster. Happy Engineers = Happy Life!
<br><br>

So after 2 weeks of hacking, going up some knowledge curves and iterations - we managed to get it all dockerized... 
<br><br>

... only to realize that the Docker experience is pretty questionable on Windows. 1 / 2 devs on our team are Windows users. Not Docker-fans and voted against it, when asked. So much for Developer Experience! 
<br><br>

Takeway - know your user.
<br><br>

Anyway, we live to learn another day!
