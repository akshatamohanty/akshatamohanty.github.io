The Professional Cloud Architect examination is a more fun exam than the Cloud Engineer exam in my opinion. While the GCP Cloud Engineer exam was more hands-on, requiring knowledge of the tools from the suite of all Google products, the Cloud Professional Architect exam requires the ability to assess trade-offs and be able to look at the big picture.

This exam requires knowledge in the following domains:

- Compute
- Storage
