				<p>The last 18-months have been hard - for everyone. We have all been united in our misery, dealt with in our own unique ways. Some have come closer, some have drifted apart. I’m a numbers person, mostly. So, here’s a quantitive twist on common anecdotes - that have helped me stay sane.</p>

<h1 id="15-minutes-documented">15-minutes, documented</h1>

<p>Last year was hard for me. I questioned every concept known to mankind - individual identity, marriage, motherhood, family, love, loyalty, trust, honesty, goals, ambitions, philanthrophy, religion and science itself. Everything that life could stand for.</p>

<p>And in all that darkness, sometimes, it was hard to continue - to keep trying to find a way, when I felt so lost. The ROI on the seemingly unending, directionless search for meaning, which quite possibly didn’t exist - was not promising.</p>

<p>So, as with all problems, I hit Google and ended up on a self-help website - which told me to take it only 5 minutes at a time. Amazingly, that did seem to work.</p>

<p>Hence, I called upon the sublime powers of Excel. Here’s a glimpse of one of the more acceptable chunks of my life.</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="../assets/images/life-in-15.png" /></p>

<p>What you are looking at is a part of my life, broken down into 15-minute, logged by category. (A - Action, T - Thinking, E - Entertainment, C - Chores). Yes, I’m weird.</p>

<p>But it allowed me evaluate my happiness and unhappiness - empirically.</p>

<p>Feeling directionless? Sure, I haven’t worked taken any actions related to goals that matter to me, in over 12 hours.
Feeling confused? Obviously, I’ve been in bed, cooking up dreams for the past 4 hours.</p>

<p>Life is more physiological and physical, than we give it credit for. Yet, most of us, live it in our heads.</p>

<p>Documenting it, helps externalize and depersonalize it. Allows us to look at our own life, from outside.</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h1 id="netflix-builds-for-failures-so-should-we">Netflix builds for failures. So should we.</h1>

<p>I failed spectacularly last year in numerous ways. You probably did too.</p>

<p>Maybe your relationship crashed and burned.</p>

<p>Maybe you got fired.</p>

<p>Maybe couldn’t do enough for your parents.</p>

<p>Maybe you miscarried and couldn’t protect your child.</p>

<p>Maybe your startup died.</p>

<p>Maybe your partner cheated on you.</p>

<p>Maybe you weren’t as smart as you thought.</p>

<p>Maybe you killed your plants, yet again.</p>

<p>And it hurt. Repeatedly. Like a white, hot iron in your brain, stabbing relentlessly, reminding you with every breath you took.
And in your pain, you lost sight.</p>

<p>Well, that’s pain for you. You are supposed to lose sight. It is supposed to be significant - or else, how would you learn?</p>

<p>How would you learn that it is all just a statistic? Being born is a conditional probability. And so are most things that happen to you. Sure, you have some control, some blame to take - but to assume all responsibility is just narcissistic. And for things to happen exactly as you predict because of your experience - would be mathematically highly improbable. (If it does, congratulations, you might be on your way to becoming a prophet - please give me your number, before you get certified as God.)</p>

<p>Humans give too much importance to themselves. But we are all just systems, deployed in production - interacting with other systems. Systems, encoded with our unique experiences. Our responses, based on algorithms that we’ve being trained on.</p>

<p>So, what is pain? It’s the alert mechanism. It’s the freaking PagerDuty at 3 a.m, telling you that your system is going bonkers.</p>

<p>Maybe it is overloaded, and your capacity planning was inaccurate.</p>

<p>Maybe there’s an edge case, that you didn’t anticipate.</p>

<p>Maybe the queue is backed up, and your system is overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Maybe a Russian hacker has attacked your system and blown it to smithereens.</p>

<p>Either way, you don’t handle PagerDuty by questioning the universe. You fix the issue. And there’s always a fix.
Patch, deploy, add to playbook, re-evalute for more robust solutions, earmark resources, work on it.</p>

<p>When you take away the humaness of pain, it reduces to being just an incident - a outage. And outages are normal.
Outages make the system stronger, a bit more resilient, everytime they hit.</p>

<h1 id="progress-is-non-linear">Progress, is non-linear.</h1>

<p>In thirty years of my life, I’d never managed to do a push-up. And it would annoy the hell out of me. So this pandemic, I decided to give it another try (probably my 10th). Only this time, instead of brute-forcing it - I decided to build upto it. At a rate of only 15-minutes at a time.</p>

<p>I didn’t set a goal - I just told myself that I would work on it for 15 minutes a day.</p>

<p>Here’s how it went,</p>

<p>Day 1: Recorded myself, my push-up looks weird, not right.</p>

<p>Day 2: Googled how to do a push-up correctly; Got a recipe: sqeeze back, tighten abs, press through the floor</p>

<p>Day 3: Reddit says strengthen core for push-ups; Let’s add hollow body planks to my routine, along-with modified push-ups</p>

<p>Day 4: My elbows look weird. Googled and fixed elbox positioning - Keeps elbows behind the middle finger and stop when shoulder blades retract.</p>

<p>Day 5 - Day 10: Continued with modified push-ups + hollow body planks</p>

<p>Day 11: My push-up still looks weird - my spine is all curve. Came across the concept of neutral spine. Added routines to practice that.</p>

<p>Day 12 onwards: Combination of the above, threw in the <a href="https://www.shape.com/fitness/workouts/30-day-push-up-challenge">30-day push-up challenge</a> to the mix.</p>

<p>And somewhere around Day 20, I managed to do a decent push-up - with extremely shaky arms.</p>

<p>Here’s around Day 30, with less shaky arms…</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="../assets/images/push-up.gif" /></p>

<p>Ever built a website? It sucks - till it doesn’t.</p>

<p>You add all the semantic HTML. It looks like a bad library website from the 90s. You divide it up into chunks. Add some CSS. Switch the colors.
Add the fonts. Nada, still sucks.</p>

<p>Then you add a grid, margins and padding.</p>

<p>And suddenly, you have a beautiful website!</p>

<p>I realise now that most things work the same way.</p>

<p>Progress, is hardly ever linear. Maybe it’s a step function. Maybe it’s exponential.</p>

<p>Point is, you keep failing everyday. Keep being wrong everyday. And it all adds up. Till one day, you aren’t failing anymore.</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h1 id="hey-jude">Hey Jude</h1>

<p>Ok, this has nothing to do with Math and everything to do with Paul McCartney’s smile. Warms my heart everytime - that’s love, I think?</p>

<p>Fine - love is never enough.</p>

<p>Anyway, cheers to Bill Davis (6:23) and the lyrics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey Jude, don’t make it bad. <br />
Take a sad song and make it better. <br />
Remember to let her into your heart, <br />
Then you can start to make it better. <br />
Hey Jude, don’t be afraid. <br />
You were made to go out and get her. <br />
The minute you let her under your skin, <br />
Then you begin to make it better. <br />
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain, <br />
Don’t carry the world upon your shoulders. <br />
For well you know that it’s a fool who plays it cool <br />
By making his world a little colder. <br /></p>
</blockquote>
