Life and loss go hand-in-hand. Everyone is going through something. And everyone has a story.

<br/>

This September, in an alternate timeline, I would have had a two-year old toddler. Something I live with on most days - some days and places, more than others.

<br/>

And today, I read one of the most beautiful and accurate descriptions of loss - inside and outside -

<br/>

Grieving is a solitary, often lonely process. Faced with feeling your own existence in stark comparitive absence of another, you are forced to face and discover yourself.

<br/>

And grief is enduring. It lingers. Probably why talking about grief is hard, awkward. There is no right thing to say. No schedule for appropriate.

<br/>

Because no, it will not get better. Life will not be the same. History will not change.

<br/>

First, it will feel like you'll explode.<br/>
Then you'll run, avoid it - numb it down anyway possible. <br/>
Then you'll allow yourself to feel it - all of it, with the finality.<br/>
Then, you'll learn to channel it. <br/>

<br/>

And then, you'll live again.

<br/>

The loss will change you, as it is supposed to. But you'll survive. And do the best you can.
