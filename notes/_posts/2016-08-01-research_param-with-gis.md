description: "Existing urban planning and design systems and workflows do not effectively support a fast iterative design process capable of generating and evaluating large-scale urban models. One of the key issues is the lack of flexibility in workflows to support iterative design generation. We present and demonstrate a parametric modelling system, Möbius, that can easily be linked to Geographic Information Systems for creating modular workflows, uses a rich topological data structure that allows custom data attributes to be added to geometric entities at any topological level, and is fully web-based."
