description: "In early stages of architectural design, highly simplified minimal models are often preferred while in the later stages maximal Building Information Models (BIM) are required that include the relevant information for detailed design documentation. This research focuses on the transition from minimal to maximal models and proposes a semi-automated workflow that consist of two main steps: analysis and templating. The analysis step starts with the minimal geometric model and decorates this model with a set of semantic and topological attributes. The templating step starts the decorated model and generates a transitional BIM model which can then be readily altered and populated with high resolution building information. A demonstration of two test cases shows the feasibility of the approach."
