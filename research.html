            <h3>Parametric Modelling with GIS</h3>
			<h5 class='authors'>Janssen, P, Stouffs, R, Mohanty, A, Tan, E, and Li, R (2016)</h5>
			<p>Existing urban planning and design systems and workflows do not effectively support a fast iterative design process capable of generating and evaluating large-scale urban models. One of the key issues is the lack of flexibility in workflows to support iterative design generation and performance analyses, and easily integrate into design and planning processes. We present and demonstrate a parametric modelling system, Möbius, that can easily be linked to Geographic Information Systems for creating modular workflows, provides a novel approach for visual programming that integrates associative and imperative programming styles, uses a rich topological data structure that allows custom data attributes to be added to geometric entities at any topological level, and is fully web-based. The demonstration consists of five main stages that alternate between QGIS and Möbius, generating and analysing an urban model reflecting on site conditions and using a library of parametric urban typologies, and uses as a case study an urban design studio project in which the students sketched a set of rules that defined site coverage and building heights based on the proximity to various elements in the design.</p>

            <h3>Möbius: A Parametric Modeller for the Web</h3>
			<h5 class='authors'>Janssen, P, Li, R, and Mohanty, A (2016)</h5>
			<p>For complex parametric modelling tasks, systems that use textual programming languages (TPLs) currently have clear ad- vantages over visual programming languages (VPLs) systems. Their support for a rich variety of programming mechanisms means that the complexity of the program can remain commensurate with the com- plexity of the modelling task. A prototype parametric modelling sys- tem called Mo?bius is presented that aims to overcome the limitations of existing VPL systems. The proposed system integrates associative and imperative programming styles and supports iterative looping and higher order functions. In order to demonstrate the versatility of the Mo?bius, a modelling task is presented that requires the model to be modified.</p>

            <h3>Automated Generation of BIM Models</h3>
			<h5 class='authors'>Janssen, P, Chen, KW, and Mohanty, A (2016)</h5>
			<p>In early stages of architectural design, highly simplified minimal models are often preferred while in the later stages maximal Building Information Models (BIM) are required that include the relevant information for detailed design documentation. This research focuses on the transition from minimal to maximal models and proposes a semi-automated workflow that consist of two main steps: analysis and templating. The analysis step starts with the minimal geometric model and decorates this model with a set of semantic and topological attributes. The templating step starts the decorated model and generates a transitional BIM model which can then be readily altered and populated with high resolution building information. A demonstration of two test cases shows the feasibility of the approach.</p>

			<h5 class='authors'>Sen, Joy, Mohanty, A (2016)</h5>
			<p>System’s approach (SA) is a holistic approach of understanding. The approach streamlines how small parts or things or events influence one another within a sequence of events, which constitutes of to-and-fro causal relationships. The network of such relationships represents a whole, where more than the co-existence of parts, the pattern of relationship gains a higher significance. Recently, the entire scientific world, ranging from social sciences to basic quantum and relativistic physics, and say, from ecology to trans-personal psychology, are being revolutionized by the system’s approach. The system approach expands from a conventional reductionist paradigm of looking at linear causal relationships to a view port of looking at things or events in a wider and deeper perspective involving a non-linear or cyclic nature.</p>
