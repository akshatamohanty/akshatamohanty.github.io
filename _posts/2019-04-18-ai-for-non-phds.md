title:  "AI for Non-PhDs - AI Superpowers for your apps in 30 minutes "
authors: JuniorDev.SG (2019)
summary:  AI is everywhere! The possibilities are endless. And with libraries like Tensorflow and Pytorch, AI is now accessible to developers like you and me, without needing years in a PhD. In this talk, we learn how to build a dog breed classifer and deploy it as a web and mobile app. And all of this, without a server! <br /> <br /> <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1gEaPTeuBmE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
