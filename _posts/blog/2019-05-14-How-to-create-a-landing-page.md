title:  What I learned from Google
summary: I recently read <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23158207-how-google-works' target='_blank'>How Google Works by Eric Schmidt and Jon Rosenberg</a>. The book talks about Google as a company and provides an inside look into the foundations, principles and culture the company is built on. Though the setting was probably written with the intention of guiding entrepreneurs - I found myself resonating with some of the core values that I'd like to apply to my life. Here are my five personal takeaways from this amazing read

# Be a 'smart creative'

The book talks extensively about `smart creatives` or `Googlers`. These are people who are intelligent, agile, grow fast, and have a figure-it-out mentality. They have been described as broad in their knowledge and skills, following core principles of movement, elasticity and speed. Such people form the pillars of Google and the book discesses ways of attracting, managing and retaining such talent.

The psyche of the smart creative definitely seemed one to strive for! For example, ... `The ads suck`. how to maintain a culture that enables them to grow and some examples from Google...

In my journey from being a hobbist to a professional developer, I've noticed the values being talked about as being very important and relevant to becoming a great programmer. Good programmers - Question everything. Enhanced curiousity. Hardword. Care about everything. 
It has served me well to develop a bias towards data and action. Instead of just talking, Googlers say `let me show you..`.

# Concentrate on first principles

Foundations are important. Everything comes from first principles. Bet on technical insight, not market strategy. The consumer can't tell you what they want it, if they don't know if it exists. Google started out with no market strategy per se. Market research can't tell you what the customer doesn't yet know he wants; technical acuity can. Example - modern modems without the hissing etc, built for newer PCs. If market research had been followed, backward compatibility with bad user experience would have been enforced.

Build technical insight and differentiation. Today requires you to grow big fast. Building platforms with a specialization is the key to next generation big products. Follow the hedgehog concept - be amazing at one key thing. Always default to open - open discussions, data. The board letters at Google are always open, the products being developed - anyone can talk to anyone culture.
Technical insight beats all. 

Always ask the question: what is the most important thing you do? Product managers get asked this.

# Prioritize

80% of your time should be dedicated to 80% of your revenue. 

Larry Page became CEO by 38. Eric Scmidt by 42. That's by which you should be feeling that you are ready to lead a company. 
Follow: 70-20-10 for resource allocation; 70% on main business, 20% for tested ideas and 10% that'll change the world. 

<br />

# Keep it open
Facilitate openness and trust. 

`Snippets` was a quick app build to keep track of work done everyday. It could be compiled for weekly progress reports, milestones etc. Keep repeating your key values - even if in different ways. Eric wanted to prioritize user experience - at one point he correlated it to the increasing sofistication of users because of the increasing length of search queries. People didn't know that statistic but it re-enforced the concentration on user experience. 

Self review. Compare yourself with yourself  - that would make for a better review. Use that to get reviews from other people - when you are open about yourself - people are more open about you. 

Another key to success, in a big company, is to be an awesome router. Keep the communication going. Larry Page could remember everything that everyone did and follow up. Eric kept notes - but notes only helped him so far. Sometimes he missed the gist that Larry didn't.

Make you OKRs openly available. They have to be ambitious. Not sandboxed. 

Optimism is important - to start new products, new startups. People would never take on anything new without optimism.

# Be anti-fragile

Fail well.
Figure out a way to let people experience the product. Fail fast, fail well. Failure should get you new data, new learnings. You have to fail well. Morph ideas - don't change them. Iterations should always be based off learnings.

Be anti-fragile. Resilient remains the same, but anti-fragile changes - evolves.

Instead of asking what could be true - ask what might be true? Predictions are mostly wrong - by laymen, experts or random change. But trying to work out what might be true - requires imagination.

You need a coach. Eric Schmidt thought he didn't but later agreed he was wrong. Coaches aren't necessarily better than the player - but they are good at observing and giving you feedback. Bill Campbell has coached both Eric and Steve Jobs.

Have a playbook. For everything. How to do this and that?
