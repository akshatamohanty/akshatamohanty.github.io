title:  artificial intelligence nanodegree - udacity
summary: In 2018, I pursued a 6 month nanodegree in Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree, being offered by Udacity. Comprised on 6 projects with a capstone project, it was a unique and in-depth overview of the field of AI/ML. I specialized in Voice User Interfaces, completing a capstone project to for speech recognition. It was one of the most intense online certifications I've done till date - and a great learning experience!
