title:  gitpub - automated gitbook publishing
summary: This nifty command came into existence to get around the paid subscription model introduced by Gitbook! The npm-command can be used to publish markdown files as Gitbooks to gh-pages automatically, using Travis.CI and the gitbook open source technology. This was used to compile collaborative books for the Urban Prototyping module at NUS in August 2018
