title:  Speech Transcription
summary: Neural network for speech transcription to function as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline
text: A deep neural network for speech transcription to function as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline. Developed for my final capstone project for the Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree, I analyzed and experimented with various models exploring different layers and configurations like RNNs (GRU, LSTM), Bidirectional RNNs, CNN + RNNs, RNN + Time Distributed Dense, Dropout, Batch Normalization, etc. 
role: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
