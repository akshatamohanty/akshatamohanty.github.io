title:  "Möbius: A Parametric Modeller for the Web"
authors: Janssen, P, Li, R, and Mohanty, A (2016)
details: Proceedings of CAADRIA 2016, 22-26 August 2016, Melbourne, Australia, pp. 157–166.
summary: Introduces a prototype parametric modelling system called Mobius, that aims to overcome the limitations of existing visual programming systems. The proposed system integrates associative and imperative programming styles and supports iterative looping and higher order functions.
