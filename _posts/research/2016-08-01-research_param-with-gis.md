abstract: "Existing urban planning and design systems and workflows do not effectively support a fast iterative design process capable of generating and evaluating large-scale urban models. One of the key issues is the lack of flexibility in workflows to support iterative design generation and performance analyses, and easily integrate into design and planning processes. We present and demonstrate a parametric modelling system, Möbius, that can easily be linked to Geographic Information Systems for creating modular workflows, provides a novel approach for visual programming that integrates associative and imperative programming styles, uses a rich topological data structure that allows custom data attributes to be added to geometric entities at any topological level, and is fully web-based. The demonstration consists of five main stages that alternate between QGIS and Möbius, generating and analysing an urban model reflecting on site conditions and using a library of parametric urban typologies, and uses as a case study an urban design studio project in which the students sketched a set of rules that defined site coverage and building heights based on the proximity to various elements in the design."
