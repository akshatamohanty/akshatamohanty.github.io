abstract: For complex parametric modelling tasks, systems that use textual programming languages (TPLs) currently have clear ad- vantages over visual programming languages (VPLs) systems. Their support for a rich variety of programming mechanisms means that the complexity of the program can remain commensurate with the com- plexity of the modelling task. A prototype parametric modelling sys- tem called Mo?bius is presented that aims to overcome the limitations of existing VPL systems. The proposed system integrates associative and imperative programming styles and supports iterative looping and higher order functions. In order to demonstrate the versatility of the Mo?bius, a modelling task is presented that requires the model to be modified.
