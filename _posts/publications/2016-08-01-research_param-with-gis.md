title:  "Parametric Modelling with GIS"
authors: Janssen, P, Stouffs, R, Mohanty, A, Tan, E, and Li, R (2016)
details: Proceedings of eCAADe 2016, 22-26 August 2016, Oulu, Finland, pp. 59–68.
summary: "Existing urban planning and design systems and workflows do not effectively support a fast iterative design process capable of generating and evaluating large-scale urban models. One of the key issues is the lack of flexibility in workflows to support iterative design generation. We present and demonstrate a parametric modelling system, Möbius, that can easily be linked to Geographic Information Systems for creating modular workflows, uses a rich topological data structure that allows custom data attributes to be added to geometric entities at any topological level, and is fully web-based."
