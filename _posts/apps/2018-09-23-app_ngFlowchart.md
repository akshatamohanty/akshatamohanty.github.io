title: ngxFlowchart - angular module to draw flow diagrams
summary: ngxflowchart is an angular module to draw and edit network graphs. Network graphs, or flowcharts are rectangular or circular nodes, with one or multiple input and outputs, connected together with wires. They are typically used to visualize control or logical flows. This module was extracted out from the Mobius project, to function as an independent library. In this project, I challenged myself by developing the graph using HTML canvas elements instead of SVG elements.
