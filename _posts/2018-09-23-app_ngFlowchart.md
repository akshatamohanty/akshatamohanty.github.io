title: ngFlowchart - render flowcharts with canvas elements
summary: ngFlowchart is an angular module to draw and edit network graphs. Network graphs, or flowcharts are rectangular or circular nodes, with one or multiple input and outputs, connected together with wires. They are typically used to visualize flows or procedures. This module was extracted out from the Mobius project to function as an independent library. In this project, I challenged myself by developing the graph using HTML canvas elements instead of SVG elements.
