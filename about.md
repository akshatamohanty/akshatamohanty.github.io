<h1>Hi. I am Akshata.</h1>

<br/>
I am a Fullstack Engineer at Rakuten Viki, based in Singapore. I am a self-taught developer and graduated with a B.Arch (Hons.), from IIT Kharagpur in India in 2015.

<br />
Before Rakuten, I was the Team Lead in the [Design Automation Lab](http://design-automation.net/){:target="_blank"}, Department of Architecture, at the National University of Singapore. In that role, I built web tools - Mobius and Studionet, to enhance design learning for budding architects.

<br />
Post graduation, I did a brief stint in the Programmatic Ads team at Flipkart Internet, Bangalore (India). During my undergradate degree, I interned at the Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane (Australia), VBHC Value Homes, Bangalore (India) and ABDC, Mumbai (India).

<br />
I feel strongly about accessible education for all and empowerment throught knowledge. I am currently a Bootcamp Coach at [TechLadies](http://www.techladies.co/bootcamp-6){:target="_blank"}, Singapore and a Mentor in the [Code with Cloud Programme by CodingGirlsSG](https://cloud.codinggirls.sg/){:target="_blank"}, Singapore. I taught myself how to code with [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com){:target="_blank"}, MITx and Coursera. I also earned two nanodegree credentials, in Deep Learning and Android Development from Udacity.

<br />
Apart from code, I love food, travel and more recently, Muay Thai.
