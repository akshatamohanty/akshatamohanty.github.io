    <h2>Hi. I am Akshata.</h2>
    <br/>
    Engineer and hobbyist thinker, based in Singapore. Orginally from India, I graduated from IIT Kharagpur with a degree in Architecture. In my second year, I coded my way out of <s>a boring</s> an automatable internship and never looked back. 
    <br/><br/>
    In 2015, I moved to Singapore to join the <u><a href='http://design-automation.net/' target='_blank'>Design Automation Lab</a></u>, at the National University of Singapore. I led development for Mobius and Studionet - open source web tools, to make code intuitive and fun! 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After three years of research papers, web graphics and parametric design, I continued my love for technology at <u><a href='https://viki.com/' target='_blank'>Viki</a></u> to bring fullstack joy to over a million K-drama fans, followed by crunching numbers (I led Data Engineering!) for the world's creators at <u><a href='https://nasacademy.com/' target='_blank'>NasAcademy</a></u>. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Currently, I lead tech and product for <u><a href='https://metaphi.xyz/' target='_blank'>Metaphi</a></u> and <u><a href='https://awen.finance/' target='_blank'>Awen Finance</a></u>. At Awen, we are building to empower SMEs and solve for the $1.7T trade finance gap in the world - a comprehensive suite of Trade Finance payment products, risk analytics and tokenization of trade assets on-chain. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div>I also organise <u><a href='https://awen.finance/' target='_blank'>Practical Blockchain</a></u> - an online group of Blockchain enthusiasts, to meet on monthly basis for smart contract workshops.
