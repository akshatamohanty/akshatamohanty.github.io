    <h2>Hi. I am Akshata.</h2>
    <br/>
    I am a Fullstack Engineer at Rakuten Viki, based in Singapore. I am a self-taught developer and graduated with a B.Arch (Hons.), from IIT Kharagpur in India in 2015.
    <br /><br />
    Before Rakuten, I was the Team Lead in the <a href='http://design-automation.net/' target='_blank'>Design Automation Lab</a>, Department of Architecture, at the National University of Singapore. In that role, I built web tools - Mobius and Studionet, to enhance design learning for budding architects.
    Post graduation, I did a brief stint in the Programmatic Ads team at Flipkart Internet, Bangalore (India). During my undergradate degree, I interned at the Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane (Australia), VBHC Value Homes, Bangalore (India) and ABDC, Mumbai (India).
    <br /><br />
    I feel strongly about accessible education for all and empowerment throught knowledge. I am currently a Bootcamp Organizer at <a href='http://www.techladies.co/bootcamp-7' target='_blank'>TechLadies</a>, Singapore. I taught myself how to code with FreeCodeCamp, MITx and Coursera. I also earned two nanodegree credentials, in Deep Learning and Android Development from Udacity.
