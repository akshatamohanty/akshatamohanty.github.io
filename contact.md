    <h2>Hi. I am Akshata.</h2>
    <br/>
    I am a Senior Engineer at Rakuten Viki, Singapore. Orginally from India and graduated with a B.Arch (Hons.) degree, from IIT Kharagpur in India in 2015. I am a self-taught developer.
    <br /><br />
    Before joining Rakuten, I was the Technical Lead for Mobius and Studionet at the <a href='http://design-automation.net/' target='_blank'>Design Automation Lab</a>, at the National University of Singapore.
    <br /><br />
    I feel strongly about accessible education for all and empowerment through knowledge. I taught myself how to code by binging on FreeCodeCamp, MITx and Coursera, using a project-centric approach. I also have two nanodegree credentials, in Deep Learning and Android Development from Udacity. Now, I organize bootcamps at <a href='http://www.techladies.co/bootcamp-7' target='_blank'>TechLadies</a>, Singapore and help others make the same journey!
