I'm a binary brain, in love with code. A serial MOOCer. An architect by degree, I found my way into software with online courses. I have over 25 online certifications in Web & Mobile Apps, Data Science, Design and Business. &nbsp;


Fascinated by the human mind, I'm interested in products that aid human potential. I was the lead developer for [Mobius]('https://github.com/design-automation/mobius-core') - a visual programming educational tool used at the National University of Singapore. 


While I'm not coding, I'm food-ing. I'm a loyal member of [Burger Buddies @ Singapore]('https://www.meetup.com/Burger-buddies/'). Hit me up for burger suggestions around town!
