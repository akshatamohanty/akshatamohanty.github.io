<p>
    I'm a binary brain, in love with code. A serial MOOCer. An architect by degree, I found my way into software with online courses. I have over 25 online certifications in Web & Mobile Apps, Data Science, Design and Business. 

    <br><br>

    Fascinated by the human mind, I'm interested in products that aid human potential. I was the lead developer for <a href='https://github.com/design-automation/mobius-core'>Mobius</a> - a visual programming educational tool used at the National University of Singapore.

    While I'm not coding, I'm food-ing. I'm a loyal member of <a href='https://www.meetup.com/Burger-buddies/' target='_blank'>Burger Buddies @ Singapore</a>. Hit me up for burger suggestions around town!
